# Reversible-Watermarking-Algorithm-for-Oblique-Photography-3D-Models
Most oblique photography 3D model watermarking algorithms only support limited data re-covery or fail to restore the original model, falling short of meeting diverse user needs. Conse-quently, this study introduces a novel reversible watermarking scheme specifically tailored for oblique photographic 3D models.
